Please see HOWTO.md for more detailled information. The following is a 
short outline:
__________________________________________________________
1. Install and run bitcoind.

You need to run bitcoind with the config option txindex=1
If you have not previously done so, you may need to reindex the bitcoind blockchain

Note: you cannot use a ultra-pruning bitcoind (forthcoming in 0.9 or later).
A full bitcoin node is required in order to know for each address 
if it has been used. Pruning occurs only at the level of the Electrum database.

__________________________________________________________

2. Install plyvel.

__________________________________________________________

3. Run the 'install' script (as root)

It will create /etc/electrum.conf, and a user running the daemon

If you do not have a database, it will propose you to download it from
the Electrum foundry.

If you do not use the foundry, it is recommended to locate your
database in shared memory:
path = /run/shm/electrum_db


______________________________________________________________

4. enjoy!

use 'electrum-server' to start and stop the server

electrum-server start
electrum-server stop
electrum-server status
electrum-server info



______________________
Troubleshooting:

* if your server or bitcoind is killed because is uses too much
memory, configure bitcoind to limit the number of connections

* if you see "Too many open files" errors, you may need to increase
your user's File Descriptors limit. For this, see
